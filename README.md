# Telecom Churn Rate Analysis & Revenue Growth

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **customer churn in the telecom industry** using Python and statistical methods.  
By leveraging **Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**, the project identifies churn patterns, visualizes insights, and proposes strategies to **reduce churn and increase revenue**.

---

## Key Objectives
- Analyze **customer churn rate** in the telecom sector.
- Identify key **factors contributing to churn** using statistical analysis.
- Create **data visualizations** to uncover trends in customer behavior.
- Provide actionable recommendations for **improving retention and boosting revenue**.

---

## Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and analysis  
- **Matplotlib** – Data visualization  
- **Seaborn** – Advanced statistical plotting  
- **Statistics module** – Basic statistical analysis  

---

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning:**
   - Imported telecom customer dataset.
   - Removed duplicates and handled missing values.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Churn rate calculation.
   - Analysis of user demographics, tenure, and plan usage.
   - Statistical insights on churn-prone segments.

3. **Data Visualization:**
   - Plotted churn distribution by key features (tenure, plan, complaints).
   - Correlation heatmaps for churn-driving variables.

4. **Business Insights:**
   - Identified high-risk churn groups.
   - Recommended strategies for churn reduction and revenue growth.

---

## Key Insights
- Customers with **low tenure and high complaints** are most likely to churn.
- Offering **personalized retention offers** can significantly reduce churn.
- **Revenue growth** can be achieved by targeting specific customer segments.

## Model for Prediction of Churn Rate
-EDA: Visualized data distributions and correlations to identify churn patterns.
-Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering: Cleaned data, encoded categories, and created features.
-Train-Test Split & Modeling: Split dataset into training and testing sets and trained a Logistic Regression model.
- Evaluation: Assessed performance using accuracy (~80%).
---

## Results & Impact
- **Churn reduction potential:** Up to 12.03% with targeted actions.  
- **Improved customer lifetime value** through loyalty-focused strategies.
